# Audit Server

The number of malware increases 
every day as fast as the number 
of vulnerabilities which can be 
exploited with malicious purpose. 
It is important that users know the 
level of commitment of their devices 
in order to allow them acting against 
those risks by neutralizing or decreasing 
their effects as much as possible.

The goal of the study is to provide 
users a tool which can inform them of 
the possible risks their devices could be 
exposed to, automating the exploit of well 
known vulnerabilities in a controlled way 
as well as detecting them in real time, 
allowing users to kill with processes which 
could be the origin of the risk. Moreover, 
this tool could sniff network packets in order 
to detect anomalies in the network traffic.

In conclusion, cyber-security will be more 
important due to the necessity of protecting 
the privacy and integrity of users in a world 
which every day is more interconnected and 
technological.

## Getting Started

````
easy_install wxPython-4.0.4-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
````

In order to install it in arch based distros you can execute:

````
pacman -S python-wxpython
````

#### Windows
