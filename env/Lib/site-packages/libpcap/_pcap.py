# The formats allowed by pcap.open() are the following:
# - file://path_and_filename [opens a local file]
# - rpcap://devicename [opens the selected device devices available on the
#   local host, without using the RPCAP protocol]
# - rpcap://host/devicename [opens the selected device available on a remote
#   host]
# - rpcap://host:port/devicename [opens the selected device available on a
#   remote host, using a non-standard port for RPCAP]
# - adaptername [to open a local adapter; kept for compability, but it is
#   strongly discouraged]
# - (NULL) [to open the first local adapter; kept for compability, but it is
#   strongly discouraged]
#
# The formats allowed by the pcap.findalldevs_ex() are the following:
# - file://folder/ [lists all the files in the given folder]
# - rpcap:// [lists all local adapters]
# - rpcap://host:port/ [lists the devices available on a remote host]
#
# Referring to the 'host' and 'port' parameters, they can be either numeric or
# literal. Since IPv6 is fully supported, these are the allowed formats:
#
# - host (literal): e.g. host.foo.bar
# - host (numeric IPv4): e.g. 10.11.12.13
# - host (numeric IPv4, IPv6 style): e.g. [10.11.12.13]
# - host (numeric IPv6): e.g. [1:2:3::4]
# - port: can be either numeric (e.g. '80') or literal (e.g. 'http')
#
# Here you find some allowed examples:
# - rpcap://host.foo.bar/devicename [everything literal, no port number]
# - rpcap://host.foo.bar:1234/devicename [everything literal, with port number]
# - rpcap://10.11.12.13/devicename [IPv4 numeric, no port number]
# - rpcap://10.11.12.13:1234/devicename [IPv4 numeric, with port number]
# - rpcap://[10.11.12.13]:1234/devicename [IPv4 numeric with IPv6 format, with
#                                          port number]
# - rpcap://[1:2:3::4]/devicename [IPv6 numeric, no port number]
# - rpcap://[1:2:3::4]:1234/devicename [IPv6 numeric, with port number]

# If it is '1' if you want a UDP data connection, '0' if you want
# a TCP data connection; control connection is always TCP-based.
# A UDP connection is much lighter, but it does not guarantee that all
# the captured packets arrive to the client workstation. Moreover,
# it could be harmful in case of network congestion.
# This flag is meaningless if the source is not a remote interface.
# In that case, it is simply ignored.

PCAP_OPENFLAG_DATATX_UDP = 0x00000002

# the RPCAP traffic as well.  If this flag is turned on, the RPCAP

# Has no effect on local interfaces or savefiles.

PCAP_OPENFLAG_NOCAPTURE_RPCAP = 0x00000004

# In presence of a large value for nbytes, WinPcap waits for the arrival
# of several packets before copying the data to the user. This guarantees
# a low number of system calls, i.e. lower processor usage, i.e. better
# performance, which is good for applications like sniffers. If the user
# sets the PCAP_OPENFLAG_MAX_RESPONSIVENESS flag, the capture driver will
# copy the packets as soon as the application is ready to receive them.
# This is suggested for real time applications (such as, for example,
# a bridge) that need the best responsiveness.
